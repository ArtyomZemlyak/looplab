"""The RENDERING half of the run-diagnostic commands (`timings`, `tokens`).

Extracted 2026-09-07 because `inspect_cmds.py` crossed the line cap
`tests/test_cli_command_groups.py::test_no_group_is_a_god_module_again` holds it to, and that guard
had already NAMED this extraction as the one to do when the headroom was spent: "the `tokens`
command's rendering half (the per-card / per-build table echoes) is a coherent unit that can move
beside `events/token_spend.py`'s pure folds into a cli-side helper module". Raising the cap instead
would have bought the room by inviting the deletion of the why-comments, which is the trade that
raise refused.

What lives here is the printing and the span vocabulary the two commands SHARE — nothing decides
anything. The folds stay where they were (`events/token_spend.py`, `engine/*`), the commands stay in
`inspect_cmds.py`, and every function here takes what it prints as an argument.
